# Raspberry-Pi-Robot
For our final project we decided to make a robot that will give the user a high five. We used parts like motors, sensors, speakers, and we used the many legos to build structures that will hold our build.

Our first steps included brainstorming ideas for our robot and we landed on a robot that can scan colors and do different actions.

# Code
Our code involves a variety of things. It has simple prints and it also has more complex things like playing the music. The code also includes the commands for when the high five happens. Unfortunately, the color sensor is poor and it can not detect colors very well but it can detect a few.
