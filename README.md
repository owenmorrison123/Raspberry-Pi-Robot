# Raspberry-Pi-Robot
For our final project we decided to make a robot that will give the user a high five. We used parts like motors, sensors, speakers, and we used the many legos to build structures that will hold our build.

Our first steps included brainstorming ideas for our robot and we landed on a robot that can scan colors and do different actions.
